## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Home page with information about coaching services
- Coaches page with filtering by role
- Booking form for coaching sessions
- Interactive elements with JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the home page
3. Navigate to the coaches page by clicking on the "Coaches" link in the navigation menu
4. Use the filter buttons on the coaches page to filter coaches by role
5. Click on a "BOOK NOW" button to fill out the booking form

## Missing Elements

For a complete clone, you would need to add:
- Actual images for the logo, coaches, and background images
- Backend functionality for form submission
- Additional pages if needed

## Notes

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS clone for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would want to:
1. Use a backend framework to handle form submissions
2. Implement proper authentication for admin access
3. Connect to a database to store coach information and booking requests
4. Use a content management system for easy updates
